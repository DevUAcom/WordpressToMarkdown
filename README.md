# WordpressToMarkdown
Converts WordPress blog posts to Markdown for a static site generator 
like [Astro](https://astro.build/).

This project is intended for .NET developers who want to migrate blog posts
from WordPress to a static site generator like Astro, Hugo, Gatsby, etc.

Since each WordPress site has its own settings and plugins, it is hard to create
a universal converter that satisfies everyone. Instead, I've created a converter
for my own needs. Other .NET developers can modify it to suit their requirements.
